# Hi, I’m Arin 

I’m a **Data Science + Analytics** professional who likes to work towards **turning messy data into decisions people can act on**.

I work where **machine learning** meets **business strategy**. I don’t stop at “the model performs well” or “the dashboard looks nice”. I focus on what changed, why it matters, and what we should do next, backed by clean analysis, strong metrics, and a story that stakeholders can trust.

---

## What I do 

- **Business-first analytics:** start with the question, define success metrics, and align stakeholders early  
- **Data to insight:** clean, validate, and build pipelines that people can trust  
- **Model with purpose:** clustering, forecasting, anomaly detection, NLP, and ML that supports a decision  
- **Measure impact:** funnels, A/B testing, ROI framing, and honest evaluation  
- **Ship:** dashboards, alerts, and repeatable workflows (not one-off notebooks)

---

## Highlights 

- Drove **go-to-market decisions** using SQL + Python + Power BI across **50+ universities**, combining segmentation, funnel modeling, and experimentation to boost **weekly engagement by 29%**  
- Built ML workflows for **steganography analysis** using SVMs and supervised learning, achieving **95% detection accuracy** and surfacing key system vulnerabilities  
- Delivered real-time analytics for oil consumption with **1M+ daily data points** and enterprise-grade dashboard governance across **200+ fuel stations**  
- Automated reporting and forecasting pipelines using **Spark + AWS**, reducing manual reporting by **39%**

## Toolbox

**Languages:** Python, SQL, R  
**ML:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, NLP workflows  
**Data + Cloud:** Spark, Databricks, AWS, Azure  
**BI + Analytics:** Power BI, Tableau  
**Engineering:** Git, Docker, CI/CD-style data pipelines

## Focus

- Product analytics and experimentation done right (funnel integrity, guardrails, interpretation)  
- Forecasting and risk modeling that holds up in real operations  
- Better MLOps habits: reproducibility, monitoring, and clean deployment paths
